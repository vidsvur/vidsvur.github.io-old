# Master's Research

### Master's Thesis: Genome annotation of the beet cyst nematode, *Heterodera schachtii*
Sep 2018 – Mar 2019

As a part of my Master's thesis at Wageningen University, I worked on the structural and functional annotation of the beet cyst nematode. This involved using programs like RepeatMasker to find repeats in the genome, MAKER and BRAKER to estimate the number of genes in this genome. This was followed by a functional annotation, using InterProScan and BLAST. I also used to DAMMIT annotation.
I was introduced to some programming and annotation pipelines.

I was supervised by [Dr. Hans Helder](https://www.wur.nl/en/Persons/Hans-dr.ir.-J-Hans-Helder.htm) and [Dr. Martijn Holterman](https://www.wur.nl/en/Persons/Martijn-dr.ir.-MHM-Martijn-Holterman.htm)




### Internship: Exploring the rose genome for resistance genes
May 2019 – Oct 2019

As a part of my internship at Dümmen Orange, I looked into the genome annotations of 'Old Blush' (Raymond et al., Saint-Oyant et al.) for resistance genes. Based on their descriptions, BLAST, comparison to other Rosaceae species, as well as selection pressure statistics (nucleotide diversity, dn/ds, fixation index and Tajima's D); it was possible to narrow down potential R genes to a few genes that may definitely have a function in conferring resistance to pathogens.
This project was done using R.

I was supervised by [Twan Kranenburg](https://nl.linkedin.com/in/twan-kranenburg-ba2826bb) and [Dr. René Smulders](https://www.linkedin.com/pub/rene-smulders/5/67a/682)

Understanding the role of Meloidogyne incognita venom like allergen protein, also known as MiVAP-1. Key learning aspects: Preparation of tissue culture plates, SDS-PAGE gels, root length analyses and ROS assays

This was also done in the [Lab of Nematology](https://www.wur.nl/en/Research-Results/Chair-groups/Plant-Sciences/Laboratory-of-Nematology.htm), under [Koen Varossieau](https://www.wur.nl/en/Persons/Koen-K-Koen-Varossieau-MSc.htm)'s supervision. 
  
# Bachelor's Research

### Bachelor's Thesis: Bioconversion of Leather Waste to Bio-fertiliser
Jan 2017 – May 2017

The project focusses on a creating a sustainable solution to deal with the amount of leather waste produced in the Vellore district, Tamil Nadu. Several strains of bacteria have been found to degrade leather. Using novel strains, we have performed pilot experiments to prove that this degraded material can facilitate faster plant growth. This involved the use of spectrophotometers, microbiology and PCRs.

This was done in [Dr Babu S](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Subramanian_Babu)'s lab, and with [Alan Pauls](https://www.linkedin.com/in/alan-pauls-10a42079/).
