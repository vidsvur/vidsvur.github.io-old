**My research**

My research interests have grown organically over the years as I followed my scientific curiosity. As an undergraduate, I had a nascent interest in genomics, but it was during my masterâ€™s program that I uncovered a true passion for deciphering host-pathogen relationships. The power of genomics to illuminate species interactions struck me while assembling the genome of the beet cyst nematode with colleagues at Wageningen University. This breakthrough project opened my eyes to the versatility of genomic tools for probing tolerance mechanisms against threats like diseases and climate change. It launched an exciting new trajectory - scaling up to forest ecosystems. How do embattled conifers leverage genetic defenses against invading insect and pathogen hordes? Does warming tilt the battle in favor of tree enemies? The questions kept multiplying. Now I harness large-scale genomic datasets and computational power to elucidate the epic interplay of genes and forests. From microscopic nematodes to towering pines, my work spans biological scales to reveal the stealth armor strategies of host species under assault.
