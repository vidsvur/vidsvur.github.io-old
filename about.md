I am a first year PhD student in the UConn [EEB department](https://eeb.uconn.edu/), interested in plant-parasitic interactions, and the evolutionary significance behind this relationship! I will be working in Dr. Jill Wegrzyn's [lab](http://plantcompgenomics.com/).

I have done my Master's in Plant Biotechnology from [Wageningen University](https://www.wur.nl/), and had the oppotunity to do my thesis at the [Lab of Nematology](https://www.wur.nl/en/Research-Results/Chair-groups/Plant-Sciences/Laboratory-of-Nematology.htm), and [Dr. Hans Helder](https://www.wur.nl/en/Persons/Hans-dr.ir.-J-Hans-Helder.htm) was my supervisor.

I did my Bachelor's in Biotechnology in [Vellore Institute of Technology, Vellore](https://vit.ac.in/). My bachelor thesis was supervised by [Dr. Babu S](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Subramanian_Babu).

Here's my [CV](docs/cv.pdf).
